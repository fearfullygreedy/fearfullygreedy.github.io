##Hello everyone!

Here I wanted to state a few points on the investment thesis I will addere to in the project:

1. Invest in Businesses that I understand
2. That have long term runways
3. Where I have a rough aproximation of its future Cash Flows
4. That are trading at least at half of those Cash Flows discounted to today
